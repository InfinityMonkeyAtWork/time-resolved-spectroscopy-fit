"""
Configuration for trspecfit function libraries.

This module defines which functions are available for use as spectral components,
time dynamics, and convolution kernels. It provides utilities for:
- Identifying function types (backgrounds, convolutions, regular components)
- Managing component naming/numbering rules
- Discovering available functions dynamically from function libraries

The configuration here determines how the YAML parser handles component definitions
and how the mcp module constructs models from user input.
